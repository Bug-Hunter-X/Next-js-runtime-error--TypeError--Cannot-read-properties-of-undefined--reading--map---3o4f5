# Next.js Runtime Error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Next.js applications and its solution.

## Description

The error 'TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')' typically occurs when you attempt to use the `.map()` method on an array or object that is undefined or null.  This often happens when data fetching or props passing isn't working as expected.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains a Next.js component that attempts to render a list of items. However, due to an error in data fetching or prop passing, the data is undefined, leading to the error.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to solve the error using optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`) operators. These operators allow you to safely access properties of potentially undefined values and provide fallback values if they are undefined.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
5. Observe the error in the browser console.
6. Replace `bug.js` with `bugSolution.js` and rerun the development server to see the corrected behavior.

This example showcases best practices for handling potential undefined values in Next.js components, preventing this common runtime error.
